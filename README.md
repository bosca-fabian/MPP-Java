# MPP-Java

<b><i>MPP project that allows a user to register children to different sport trials.</i></b>


The database system used for the project is <b>PostgreSQL</b> because of the ease of use with pgAdmin4 and open sourceness.

Locally, the app can run both a client and a server. The client's interface has been done using <b>Scene Builder</b> and <b>JavaFX</b>. Cross-platform wise, it has been tested and can run multiple clients that connect to a C# written server. The entirety of this feature was done using <b>Protocol Buffers</b> because of the wide use, the utility and open sourceness.

A REST client and a REST Server can also be found for the entity <i>Trial</i>. The REST Server has been tested using the Java written REST Client, a C# written REST Client and with the use of Postman.
